        The World Economic Forum recently issued its annual Global
        Information Technology Report 2016, featuring the latest data
        on Networked Readiness Index, which assesses the factors,
         policies and institutions that enable a country to fully
          leverage information and communication technologies for
           increased competitiveness and well-being.
        This year, countries were evaluated in accordance with
        four categories of indicators: the general environment to
        create and use technologies; network readiness in terms of
         the availability of Information and Communication Technologies
         (ICT) infrastructure; the use of new technologies by the government,
          private sector and individuals; economic and social impact of new
          technologies. Three leaders of the rating from the previous year
          retained their positions – Singapore, Finland and Sweden. Kazakhstan
          holds the leading position among the Commonwealth of Independent
          States (CIS countries) and heads a regional rating. According to
          the development of legislation in the field of ICT, Kazakhstan
           ranked 38th this year, which is 10 levels higher than in 2015.
            In comparison to the past year, the country went 15 positions
            up concerning internet access in schools, reaching the 41st place.

        Employment of computer programmers is projected to decline 8 percent from 2016 to 2026.
        Computer programming can be done from anywhere in the world,
        so companies sometimes hire programmers in countries where wages
        are lower. This ongoing trend is projected to limit employment growth
        for computer programmers in the United States. However, the high costs
        associated with managing projects given to overseas programmers sometimes
        offsets the savings from the lower wages, causing some companies to bring
        back or keep programming jobs in the United States.
        Job Prospects
        Job prospects will be best for programmers who have a bachelor�s
        degree or higher and knowledge of a variety of programming languages.
        Keeping up to date with the newest programming tools will also improve
        job prospects.
